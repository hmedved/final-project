          Cres (pronounced [t͡srɛ̂ːs]; Italian: Cherso, German: Kersch, Latin:
          Crepsa, Greek: Χέρσος, Chersos) is an Adriatic island in Croatia. It
          is one of the northern islands in the Kvarner Gulf and can be reached
          via ferry from Rijeka, the island Krk or from the Istrian peninsula
          (line Brestova-Porozina). With an area of 405.78 km2,[2] Cres is the
          same size as the neighbouring island of Krk, although Krk has for many
          years been thought the largest of the islands. Cres has a population
          of 3,079 (2011).[1][3] Cres and the neighbouring island of Lošinj once
          used to be one island, but were divided by a channel and connected
          with a bridge at the town of Osor. Cres's only fresh water source is
          the Lake Vrana.
